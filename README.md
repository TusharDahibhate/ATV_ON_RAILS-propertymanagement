admin username: admin@admin
password: admin

Few things to note: 
1. Admin can not create houses or inquiries, but he can edit and destroy them. 
    Letting admin create houses causes instability with other operations (like: Where should interested list be shown? and similar functionalities)
2. Interest in house and inquiries can be posted by house hunter while seeing an individual house.
3. If a user registers for househunter and realtor with same email but different passwords, the latest password entered will be used.
